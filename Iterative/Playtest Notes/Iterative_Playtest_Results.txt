Notes:
- Levels should be longer
- More levels and more variety if possible
- Make things easier to see
- Fundamentals and essentials are decently implemented
- Sounds/music should be added

Reflections:

It seems that I managed to do some decent polish on the gameplay, mainly the strafing and jumping.
The levels being wider rly helped and now the strafing feels much nicer.

It seems I properly added the essential menus.

Things I'll need to focus on for next time:

-The levels should be longer and could use some more polish.
I'll focus more on improving my levels with the mechanics I already have.

-The visuals need some work since it's a bit hard to see and discern.

-I should really add sounds/music.
